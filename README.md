## Developing a Flight Delay Prediction Model using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
 The main objective of the model isto predict flight delays accurately in order to optimize flight operations and minimize delays.using 
 a machine learning model, we can predict flight arrival delays. The input to our algorithm is rows of feature vector like departure date,
 departure delay, distance between the two airports, scheduled arrival time etc. We then use decision tree classifier to predict if the flight arrival
 will be delayed or not. A flight is considered to be delayed when difference between scheduled and actual arrival times.Furthermore, we compare 
 decision tree classifier with logistic regression and a simple neural network for various figures of merit.
